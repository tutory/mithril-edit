# mithril-edit

wysiwyg build with mithril

# Status

heavy WIP

To try the current state checkout this repo, and 
```
cd mithril-edit
npm install
cd example
npm install
http-server &
npm run watch
```

you must have `watchify` and `http-server` installed globaly

# Goal

All wysiwyg editors are heavily bloated. Let's change that
